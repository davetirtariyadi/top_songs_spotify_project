Here, mention refers to having a song categorized as “top” on Spotify in the 2003-2023 period. It is important to note that one song can be mentioned as “top” multiple times. As seen below, Rihanna’s Diamonds and Taylor Swift’s I Knew You Were Trouble were made it to the list of top songs twice.\n\nsongs %&gt;% \n  filter(artist %in% c(\"Rihanna\", \"Drake\", \"Taylor Swift\")) %&gt;% \n  group_by(artist, title) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   artist, title [6]\n  artist       title                             n\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;                         &lt;int&gt;\n1 Rihanna      Diamonds                          2\n2 Rihanna      Only Girl (In The World)          2\n3 Rihanna      S&M                               2\n4 Rihanna      Stay                              2\n5 Taylor Swift I Knew You Were Trouble.          2\n6 Taylor Swift Love Story (Taylor’s Version)     2\n\n\n\n\nTop genres\n\nsongs %&gt;% \n  group_by(`top genre`) %&gt;% \n  count() %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;% \n  head(20) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(`top genre`, n), x = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most common genres in the list of top songs in Spotify\",\n    y = \"\",\n    x = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nWe see that “dance pop” and “pop” are the two most common genres within top songs by a large margin.
